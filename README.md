# Implementation-of-naive-base-classifier
Implement Naïve Bayes Classifier; train and test it against a given dataset.
# PROBLEM:
In this assignment you need to implement the Naïve Bayes Classifier. The classifier should work on any data set. You will run this classifier for the Play Golf data set. The data set will be given separately.
Data Set: The data set has 2 classes, 4 features and 13 samples. In desperate situation, a classifier that works on specific type of data sets i.e. ones with 2 classes and 4 features, will also be accepted.
